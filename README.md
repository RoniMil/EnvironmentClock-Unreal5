## Details

This project is a live simulation developed in Unreal Engine, representing a clock through a dynamic 3D environment. It uses objects, characters, and interactive elements to display the current time in sync with the system's real-time clock.
The clock is inspired by the game Portal 2 and uses several assets imported from the game, including textures, objects and sounds.
The elements:

1. Seconds - represented by the glowing stars.
2. Minutes - represented by the turrets in the testing tube.
3. Hours - represented by the number of turned on monitors.
   Additionaly, the lighting is also dynamic and changes according to the time of day.

The clock has a UI that triggers several options with button presses/keyboard keys presses:

1. Reset (R) - resets the clock.
2. Default Cam (1) - changes the camera to scene facing view (default).
3. Turret Cam (2) - changes the camera to view the inside of the test tube.
4. Boogie (M) - Activates the radio. Also makes the scientist dance if idle.

There are additional special events that happen in certain time marks.
